# bus-mall

## Introduction

    BusMall is a simulated Web Application designed to collect and capture user preferences on a list of imaginary items based on a polling system.

## Explantion

    This Web Application uses JavaScript to randomly display 3 item images at a time in rotation (and never show any image twice in a row) and asks the user to select the most prefered item. The application will collect the polling data and display the results at the end once the user has provided enough data.
